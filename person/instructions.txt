Write a simple application (feel free to use any frameworks) that will allow a user to search through the attached data. The application should have a text input box and a “search” button that will execute the search (screen1). Extra credit if you can make it search as you type instead of hitting the button but either solution is fine.
The result of the search should be displayed below the search box as a set of tiles. 4 tiles across. (Screen2)
User should have the ability to clear the search.
Tile borders should be either red or blue depending on the gender.

How would you modify the UI to be responsive?

Will this implementation work with touch-based devices and mobile device? Why or why not?
